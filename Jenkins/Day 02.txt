7. Integrate the Public GitHub Repo with Jenkins 

8. Build the code available in Public Repo using Jenkins

9. Build Triggers
Build Triggers defines how do you want to build a job.
	1. Manual Build
	2. Automated Builds - Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts), Build after other projects are built, Build periodically, GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling, Poll SCM

Whenever developer commits the changes to the GitHub repo, automatically the changes has to be identified by the Jenkins and the job should get triggered.

9. Build Triggers - Build periodically
Build Periodically will trigger the job automatically based on the cron expression.

To schedule a job, we will use CRON expression
* * * * *	-----> Every minute
H/2 * * * * -----> Every 30 minutes
H * * * * ----> Every 60 minutes

On Sept 02, 2025 at 9.00 PM i want to schedule a job?

The limitation with Build Periodically option is, unnecessary builds will happen
Build Periodically doesn't look for the changes committed to the repo.
It will automatically build the job based on the cron expression.
This will consume the EBS volume capacity

10.  Build Periodically - Poll SCM
Poll SCM will build the job only if there is a change in the GitHub repo.

To schedule a job, we will use CRON expression
* * * * *	-----> Every minute
H/2 * * * * -----> Every 30 minutes
H * * * * ----> Every 60 minutes

Poll SCM will wait for 1 minute, and if there is a change committed in that 1 minute, Jenkins will trigger the job
Poll SCM has a wait time

11.  Build Periodically - GitHub Hook Trigger
Here there is no wait time. 
As soon as there is a change in the GitHub repo, Jenkins will identify the change and immediately it will trigger the job

12.  Build Periodically - Build After Other Projects Are Built (Upstream and Downstream Jobs)
The execution of the next job is dependent upon the execution of the present job

Job01 - Manual Trigger ---- Success
Job02 - Job 1 should trigger Job2 ---- Success
Job03 - Job 2 should trigger Job3

Job01 - git checkout
Job02 - mvn clean
Job03 - mvn package
Job04 - Deployment

Note: You need to manually trigger the job atleast once

Job01
Job02 ----> Job01
Job03 ----> Job02

Job01 ----> No Upstream Job, Downstream Job is Job02
Job02 ----> Job01 is Upstream Job, Downstream Job is Job03
Job03 ----> Job02 is Upstream Job, No Downstream Job

Build Queue is also part of Upstream and Downstream Jobs

13. Build Executor Status
To change the number of builds to run parallelly we will use Build Executor Status

14. Disk Space Monitoring Thresholds

15. Trigger Builds Remotely
Jenkins Admin ----> To build the job 

Person 1 ----> Configure the job -----> Jenkins Admin (out of station)

TOKEN NAME
Jenkins URL with Token Name -----> Jenkins Admin ----> Trigger the URL -----> Username and Password -----> Automatically the job will be built
